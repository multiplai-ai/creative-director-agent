# /cd/research — Visual Research & Competitive Analysis

Harvest competitor and aspirational brand references, analyze visual patterns, and synthesize structured research that feeds the creative foundation.

**When to use:** First stage of the Creative Director suite. Run this before `/cd/mood`.

**Prerequisites (soft — extract what's available, proceed with assumptions if missing):**
- `{entity-dir}/strategy/discovery-intake.md`
- `{entity-dir}/strategy/positioning-strategy.md`
- `{entity-dir}/strategy/icp-personas.md`
- `{entity-dir}/strategy/brand-strategy.md`

---

## Inputs

1. **Entity name** (required) — e.g., "Acme Corp", "ExampleClient"
2. **Competitor URLs** (user provides) — live websites to analyze
3. **Aspirational brand references** (URLs or descriptions) — brands outside the space whose visual approach is worth studying
4. **Anti-references** (what to avoid) — "don't look like X"

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Entity Directory

Map entity name to directory:
1. Check `entities/{name}/` (lowercase, slugified)
2. If not found, ask the user for the correct path

Set `{entity-dir}` to the resolved path. Confirm with user: "Working in `{entity-dir}/creative/` — correct?"

### Step 2: Load Strategy Context

Read available strategy artifacts from `{entity-dir}/strategy/`:

| Artifact | Extract | Used For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `discovery-intake.md` | Business context, customer language, competitors mentioned | Framing the visual research |
| `positioning-strategy.md` | Positioning anchor, differentiation, competitive set | Knowing what to differentiate FROM |
| `icp-personas.md` | Target audience, their sophistication, their world | Informing visual taste level |
| `brand-strategy.md` | Voice, personality, tone attributes | Connecting visual feel to verbal identity |

**If any artifacts are missing:**
- Note explicitly which are missing and what assumptions you're making
- Example: "No positioning strategy found. Assuming differentiation needs are general — will revisit after `/cd/mood`."
- Do NOT stop. Proceed with what's available.

### Step 3: Collect References

If the user hasn't provided URLs yet, ask:

```
I need reference URLs to analyze. Please provide:

1. COMPETITOR SITES (2-5)
   Direct competitors — the brands your audience is comparing you to.
   → URLs:

2. ASPIRATIONAL REFERENCES (2-3)
   Brands outside your space whose visual approach you admire.
   Not "I want to look like them" — "I like how they FEEL."
   → URLs or descriptions:

3. ANTI-REFERENCES (optional)
   Anything you explicitly don't want to look like.
   → URLs or descriptions:
```

**If user provides no URLs at all:** Do not proceed without at least 2-3 competitor sites. Push back: "I need at least 2 competitor URLs to establish a visual baseline. Who are your closest competitors?"

### Step 4: Create Directory Structure

Create the following directories (if they don't exist):

```
{entity-dir}/creative/
{entity-dir}/creative/references/
{entity-dir}/creative/references/competitors/
{entity-dir}/creative/references/aspirational/
{entity-dir}/creative/references/screenshots/
```

### Step 5: Automated Baseline Analysis

For EACH competitor and aspirational URL, use WebFetch to pull and analyze the site. Extract and document:

| Dimension | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Color palette** | Primary, secondary, accent colors. Background treatment. Dark vs light mode. Monochrome vs multi-color. |
| **Typography** | Headline fonts (serif, sans, display). Body fonts. Weight usage. Size hierarchy. Letter-spacing patterns. |
| **Spacing & grid** | Dense vs spacious. Fixed grid vs organic. Padding ratios. Whitespace philosophy. |
| **Layout patterns** | Hero approach. Card systems. Sections vs continuous scroll. Asymmetry vs symmetry. |
| **Button styles** | Border-radius (pill vs square vs rounded). Fill vs outline vs ghost. CTA language style. |
| **Imagery approach** | Photography vs illustration vs abstract. People vs objects vs diagrams. Crop style. |
| **Texture & depth** | Flat vs layered. Shadows vs no shadows. Grain, noise, paper textures. Gradients. |
| **Overall energy** | Corporate vs casual. Technical vs warm. Minimal vs maximal. Restrained vs expressive. |

**Per-site output format:**

```markdown
### [Site Name] — [URL]

**Category:** Competitor / Aspirational
**First impression:** [2-3 word gut reaction to the visual feel]

**Color:** [Description + extracted hex values where possible]
**Typography:** [Font names if identifiable, weight/size patterns]
**Spacing:** [Dense/moderate/spacious, grid structure]
**Layout:** [Key patterns — hero type, section structure, card usage]
**Buttons:** [Shape, fill, style]
**Imagery:** [Type, treatment, subjects]
**Texture/Depth:** [Flat/layered, shadow/no shadow, effects]
**Energy:** [Overall feel in 3-5 descriptors]

**What works well:** [1-3 specific things worth noting]
**What to avoid:** [1-2 things that don't align with this brand's needs]
```

### Step 6: Save Harvested Code

If WebFetch captures any usable HTML, Tailwind, or SVG code from reference sites, save them as individual files:

- **Competitor code** → `{entity-dir}/creative/references/competitors/{site-name}-{element}.html`
- **Aspirational code** → `{entity-dir}/creative/references/aspirational/{site-name}-{element}.html`

Add a comment header to each file:

```html
<!-- Source: {URL} -->
<!-- Captured: {date} -->
<!-- Element: {what this is — hero section, nav, card grid, etc.} -->
<!-- Notes: {why this is worth keeping} -->
```

**Save code snippets, not screenshots.** Code is reusable; screenshots are dead ends.

### Step 7: Manual Enrichment Checkpoint

After automated analysis, prompt the user for additional references:

```
ENRICHMENT CHECKPOINT

Automated analysis complete. If you have additional references, add them now:

- SuperDesign Chrome ext grabs (clean Tailwind HTML)
- SVG Gobbler grabs (SVGs from reference sites)
- CSS Peeper grabs (color palettes, font stacks)
- Any other screenshots, PDFs, or code snippets

Save files directly to:
  {entity-dir}/creative/references/competitors/
  {entity-dir}/creative/references/aspirational/
  {entity-dir}/creative/references/screenshots/

When ready, say "continue" and I'll synthesize everything.
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 8: Synthesize Research

Analyze ALL references (automated + manually added) and synthesize findings across these dimensions:

**8.1 Visual Pattern Analysis**
- What patterns repeat across competitors? (This is the category baseline.)
- What patterns repeat across aspirational brands? (This is the aspiration target.)
- Where do competitors converge? (Opportunities to differentiate by breaking convention.)

**8.2 Color Trends**
- Dominant palette families across the competitive set
- Color temperature (warm vs cool)
- Background approaches (white, dark, colored, textured)
- Accent usage (how many brands use a single accent vs multi-color)

**8.3 Typography Trends**
- Serif vs sans-serif dominance
- Display/decorative font usage
- Weight distribution (heavy headline + light body vs uniform)
- Monospace or technical font presence

**8.4 Texture & Depth Patterns**
- Flat design prevalence
- Shadow/elevation usage
- Grain, noise, paper texture usage
- Gradient approaches

**8.5 Differentiation Opportunities**
Map visual patterns back to business differentiation from strategy:
- "If positioning says 'we're the human alternative to automated tools,' what visual patterns reinforce humanity vs automation?"
- "If the competitive set is all dark + techy, is there an opportunity in light + warm?"
- "What visual conventions can we break without losing category credibility?"

**8.6 Anti-Patterns**
From user-provided anti-references AND from the competitive analysis:
- What patterns would make this brand blend in rather than stand out?
- What approaches conflict with the brand personality?

### Step 9: CHECKPOINT — Present Research Synthesis

Present the full synthesis to the user for review. Format:

```
RESEARCH SYNTHESIS — {Entity Name}

Here's what I found across {N} competitor and {N} aspirational references.

[Full synthesis from Step 8]

Does this capture the landscape accurately?
Anything to add, correct, or re-weight before I write the artifact?
```

Wait for user approval before writing the final artifact.

### Step 10: Write Output Artifact

Save the complete research document to `{entity-dir}/creative/visual-research.md`.

---

## Output Artifact

**Save to:** `{entity-dir}/creative/visual-research.md`

**Structure:**

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] At least 2 competitor sites analyzed with WebFetch
- [ ] Color, typography, spacing, layout, buttons, imagery, texture all covered per site
- [ ] Differentiation opportunities connect back to business positioning (not just "be different")
- [ ] Anti-patterns are specific (not just "avoid being boring")
- [ ] Harvested code files saved with source headers
- [ ] User approved the synthesis before the final artifact was written
- [ ] Output saved to `{entity-dir}/creative/visual-research.md`
- [ ] Directory structure created under `{entity-dir}/creative/references/`

---

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

**DON'T:**
- Skip WebFetch analysis and just describe sites from memory
- Save screenshots instead of code — code is reusable, screenshots are dead ends
- Analyze visual patterns in isolation from business strategy
- Present "differentiation" that's just aesthetic preference without strategic rationale
- Proceed without at least 2 competitor URLs
- Write the artifact without user checkpoint approval

**DO:**
- Extract specific hex values, font names, spacing patterns — concrete data, not vibes
- Map every visual observation back to "so what does this mean for differentiation?"
- Save reusable code with clear source attribution
- Ask for manual enrichment — user often has chrome extension grabs ready
- Note assumptions explicitly when strategy docs are missing

---

## Quick Actions

After running `/cd/research`:

- "Add more competitors" -> Re-run Steps 5-9 with additional URLs, append to artifact
- "Deep dive on {site}" -> Expanded analysis of one reference
- "Compare {site A} vs {site B}" -> Side-by-side visual comparison
- "What should I grab with SuperDesign?" -> Specific elements to harvest from identified sites

**Next step:** Run `/cd/mood` to create the visual direction from this research.
